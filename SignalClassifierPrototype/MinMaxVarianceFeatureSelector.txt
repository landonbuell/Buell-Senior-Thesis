"Minimum-Maximum Variance Feature Selector" Method

Goal:
	Identify what features in a design matrix contain the lowest intra-class variance and the highest extra-class variance


Method:

	require: X - design Matrix w/ shape: (numSamples x numFeatures)
	require: Y - target Vector w/ shape: (numSamples x 1)
	
	Initialize Output Matrix 'Z' which has shape (numClasses x numFeatures)
	Z <- 2D matrix of floats

	for i = 0,1,2,...,numClasses - 1:
		
		create "a" which is a subset of "X" containing only samples that belong to class "i"
		If 'n' samples belong to class 'i', then 'a' has shape (n x numFeatures)
		a <- X where (Y == i)

		for j = 0,1,2,....,numFeatures - 1:
			
			compute the variance of each feature in 'a'
			v <- has shape (numClasses x 1)

			Copy Elements of v into output matrix, Z

	return Z
			
	
Result:

	A Matrix 'Z' with shape (numClasses x numFeatures)
